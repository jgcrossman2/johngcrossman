		<div>Adventure Capitalism - Looking for Alpha
Capital markets have consolidated over the last few decades. 
Regulations designed to make markets safer have turned them into places where most of the alpha has already been extracted. 
Market returns for market risk has its place in the investment landscape but that is not what we are talking about…
Alpha still exists but the market structures have allowed certain groups to consolidate wealth, power and opportunities.

Venture Capital firms control the high ground and, if you are in the club, you are given privileged access to the deals that are not only laden with alpha but drive all the innovation in the economy.
It is time for brave bands of Adventure Capitalists to form and strike out into the dark land.
A frontal assault on these bastions of “diamond handed” investors would be costly in time and resources. 
A better way is to identify the “paper hands”. Ex-founders and angel investors may be enticed to trade shares for liquidity. 
And, through the ROFR process, a small band of intrepid investors can come together to bid for these bits of alpha laden treasure.
What will we if we can find some of these paper hands? What any raider would do?Bring it back to the market place, tokenize it and trade the hell out of it.</div>
