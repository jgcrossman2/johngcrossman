      <h2>Flux Financial - Merging Crypto and Securities</h2>
      <p>Flux Financial is currently working on two projects that each seek to bring the world of traditional securities and Cryptocurrencies closer together.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Bond - Turning a Cryptocurrency asset into a deliverable security</h3>
      <div><img src="image/BitcoinBond.png" width="30%"></img></div>
      <p>The Bitcoin Bond will be issued to investors who are willing to lend their Bitcoin to Bitcoin Holding Inc. Bitcoin Holding Inc. will issue a bond denominated in Bitcoin with a maturity of around two years. The Bond will be serviced by Flux Registry, an SEC registered Transfer Agent. At the instruction of the bond holder, Flux Registry will deliver the bond through the Depository Trust Corporation (DTC) System to any of it's member brokerage firms for credit to the investor's account.</p>
      <p>Flux will file an S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) so that the Bonds can be held, traded and potentially margined at existing financial institutions.</p>
      <p>We believe this method will yield a Bitcoin linked asset that will introduce a class of institutional investors who are unable to custody Bitcoin in the tradition fashion.</p>
      <h3>Munidollars - Stable Coin backed by Taxing Authority</h3>
      <div><img src="image/MunidollarFlow.png" width="60%"></div>
      <p>Cities, Counties and States can leverage their existing vendor payment operations to create a new class of Stable Coins which we have dubbed "Munidollars".</p>
      <p>The Municipality is allowed, through its bonding authority, to issue short term debt (knows as Tax Anticipation Notes) to finance regular operations.</p>
      <p>Flux proposes that the Municipality use that authority to pay vendor invoices in short term obligations, or Munidollars.</p>
      <p>As the Munidollars will be administered by Flux Registry, an SEC registered Transfer Agent, the vendors will have several options for their Munidollars. The most likely course will be to sell them to Flux Securities, a Broker/Dealer to be regulated by FINRA, at a slight discount to their face value.</p>
      <p>Initially, that discount will be determined by the approximately one year interest rate prevailing for the Municipality's bonds because Munidollars are convertible, at the holders option, into short term municipal paper.</p>
      <p>As part of the agreement with the Municipality, Munidollars can also be used to satisfy any outstanding payments to the Municipality (taxes, fees, fines) at face value, giving taxpayers and incentive to acquire Munidollars and pay their obligations to the Municipality with a small net discount.</p>
      <p>Because Flux Registry is capable of transferring Munidollars from registered form into an Ethereum Stable Coin, we believe there is demand for Munidollars amongst the traditional users of Stable Coins. A Stable Coin, backed by the taxing power of a Municipality, is likely to be more trusted than one backed by current methods.</p>
