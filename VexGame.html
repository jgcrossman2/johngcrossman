		<div>Many of you are veterans of the crypto markets, having ridden BTC and ETH through multiple 10x ups and 90% downs.

You've invested in shitcoins that pumped and dumped, sometimes making a profit, sometimes getting rugged. Playing with memecoins was part of the game.

But over time, it becomes clear that, aside from BTC and ETH, most coins lack a real use case that generates enough value to drive their economics.

They're all just shitcoins and memecoins.

You're looking for something better.

Public equities?

They don't give the same rush. They're overpriced due to mutual funds, pension funds, and ETFs.

Most companies only go public when they're done growing, seeking exit liquidity instead of growth capital.

Startups are different.

They're volatile, risky, and information can be scarce. They often spend years on the razor's edge of glory and destruction. But the problem is, startup investments are monopolized by a small group of well-connected Silicon Valley insiders, the Venture Capitalists.

But we're smart.

We know how to hit the VCs where they are weak and take the alpha back!

At Vex, we target ex-employees and pre-series A angel investors, who are often over-allocated and desperate to sell.

We lead our groups through the Right of First Refusal (ROFR) process, providing these paper hands the liquidity they want while pressuring companies to take our glorious bandits onto their cap table.

They'll have to listen eventually because we can ROFR them over and over again with the same money until they fold.

Taking a ragtag band of traders against the mega-VCs isn't easy, but it sure is fun.

</div>
		<div>Now that you have identified yourself as a Qualified Purchaser, we will create an account at Vex Securities so that you can bid.
We will need a copy of your government ID with you address. If you are using a Passport as your primary ID, we will ask you to input the address information.

There are also a few required questions that allow us to perform Know Your Client/Anti-Money Laundering (KYC/AML) checks.

Your information will be reviewed by the principals of Vex Securities and, when accepted, you will be ready to start bidding on auctions.

		<div>The Auction
</div>
		<div>Let’s see the bidding process in detail
</div>
		<div>The goal of the auction is to discover the price at which we can bid for 1% of the target company.
To keep things standardized, we will start each auction at $1 per unit for a minimum bid of 1000 units. The fund will be looking to fill out 1m units to launch the bid. If the bidding were to start at $1 that implies a market value for the company of $100m.

There will be two results to the auction:
1. Not enough interest. After 5 days, the auction did not attract the $1m in bids required. By extension, that means our customers were not interested in this one.
2. Bids amount to $1m or more. After 5 days, we will close the auction and start approaching sellers at the price determined by the auction.
