		<div>Many of you are veterans of the crypto markets, having ridden BTC and ETH through multiple 10x ups and 90% downs.

You've invested in shitcoins that pumped and dumped, sometimes making a profit, sometimes getting rugged. Playing with memecoins was part of the game.

But over time, it becomes clear that, aside from BTC and ETH, most coins lack a real use case that generates enough value to drive their economics.

They're all just shitcoins and memecoins.

You're looking for something better.

Public equities?

They don't give the same rush. They're overpriced due to mutual funds, pension funds, and ETFs.

Most companies only go public when they're done growing, seeking exit liquidity instead of growth capital.

Startups are different.

They're volatile, risky, and information can be scarce. They often spend years on the razor's edge of glory and destruction. But the problem is, startup investments are monopolized by a small group of well-connected Silicon Valley insiders, the Venture Capitalists.

But we're smart.

We know how to hit the VCs where they are weak and take the alpha back!

At Vex, we target ex-employees and pre-series A angel investors, who are often over-allocated and desperate to sell.

We lead our groups through the Right of First Refusal (ROFR) process, providing these paper hands the liquidity they want while pressuring companies to take our glorious bandits onto their cap table.

They'll have to listen eventually because we can ROFR them over and over again with the same money until they fold.

Taking a ragtag band of traders against the mega-VCs isn't easy, but it sure is fun.

		<div>Let’s see the bidding process in detail
</div>
		<div>SPV5</div>
		<div>SPV4</div>
		<div>The goal of the auction is to discover the price at which we can bid for 1% of the target company.
To keep things standardized, we will start each auction at $1 per unit for a minimum bid of 1000 units. The fund will be looking to fill out 1m units to launch the bid. If the bidding were to start at $1 that implies a market value for the company of $100m.

There will be two results to the auction:
1. Not enough interest. After 5 days, the auction did not attract the $1m in bids required. By extension, that means our customers were not interested in this one.
2. Bids amount to $1m or more. After 5 days, we will close the auction and start approaching sellers at the price determined by the auction.

		<div>Who are we: Vex Securities - FINRA regulated Broker Dealer
Vex Registry - SEC regulated Transfer Agent
Vex Capital - Exempt Private Fund Advisor

What do we do:
Vex Capital creates Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) to bid for 1% stakes of VC funded companies. Vex Registry is appointed to keep track of money and units. Vex Secuities is appointed to onboard clients, accept bids, and organize and price the auctions.

Where:
US for regulations. Our targets? Where ever the VC funded companies are located.

Why Auctions: 
Auctions determine our bid price. If the auction raises $1m or more, we will find sellers. If it does not, we will assume that there isn’t interest in the target company.
</div>
		<div>OK, let’s move on to the good stuff
</div>
		<div>Who? What? Where? Why?
</div>
		<div>Now that you have attached your wallet, we are ready to submit our bid. You are the first but others may join. If there is enough interest (at least $1m), the SPV will go hunting.

		<div>You are currently bidding in two auctions, The first auction is on its last day. The second auction is the one we were just looking at. You have placed two bids and now you are looking to increase.</div>
		<div>During the LexCorp bidding, we noticed that others were starting to place bids above $1.00. You think the firm is worth around $200m. Let’s move one to $1.03 and the other to $1.05 for now.</div>
		<div>But we are here to either increase a current bid or enter a new bid. Since bids are honored in price then time priority, you might have a preference of one action over the other.</div>

		<div>0.005%
</div>
		<div>Our bid is loaded up, ready to be upgraded. We can increase the bid price (which is a limit order) and/or the number of units. We will start by increasing our price from $1.00 to $1.03
</div>
		<div>Cancel</div>
		<div>$5,000</div>
		<div>We are willing to bid up to $1.03 which implies a $103m valuation. Note that if the auction closes at $1.00, $1.01 or $1.02, that is the price we will pay and our wallet will be refunded.
</div>
		<div>5,000</div>
		<div>Since we have seen some of the other bids start to come in, we will also increase the number of units from 5,000 to 20,000. Units are allocated in price, then time priority.
