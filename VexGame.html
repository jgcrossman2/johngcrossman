		<div>Many of you are veterans of the crypto markets, having ridden BTC and ETH through multiple 10x ups and 90% downs.

You've invested in shitcoins that pumped and dumped, sometimes making a profit, sometimes getting rugged. Playing with memecoins was part of the game.

But over time, it becomes clear that, aside from BTC and ETH, most coins lack a real use case that generates enough value to drive their economics.

They're all just shitcoins and memecoins.

You're looking for something better.

Public equities?

They don't give the same rush. They're overpriced due to mutual funds, pension funds, and ETFs.

Most companies only go public when they're done growing, seeking exit liquidity instead of growth capital.

Startups are different.

They're volatile, risky, and information can be scarce. They often spend years on the razor's edge of glory and destruction. But the problem is, startup investments are monopolized by a small group of well-connected Silicon Valley insiders, the Venture Capitalists.

But we're smart.

We know how to hit the VCs where they are weak and take the alpha back!

At Vex, we target ex-employees and pre-series A angel investors, who are often over-allocated and desperate to sell.

We lead our groups through the Right of First Refusal (ROFR) process, providing these paper hands the liquidity they want while pressuring companies to take our glorious bandits onto their cap table.

They'll have to listen eventually because we can ROFR them over and over again with the same money until they fold.

Taking a ragtag band of traders against the mega-VCs isn't easy, but it sure is fun.
