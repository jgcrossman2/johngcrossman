                Many of you are veterans of the crypto markets, having ridden BTC and ETH through multiple waves. Playing with memecoins was part of the game.

                <br/>
                But what about equities? How can we make them punk again?

                They don't give the same rush. All the action is dominated by big institutions: mutual funds, pension funds, and ETFs.

                <br/>
                Are you an investor who doesn't have access to VC private deal flow? Are you an angel investor who wants to double down on a company but doesn’t have the check size to propose a whole round?

                Do you want to play??

                At Vex, we are building markets that allow you to participate in some of the most interesting and innovative private companies on the planet.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                What are they worth?
                <br/>
                <br/>
                You start with an auction…
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Every day, Vex will launch a new 5 day auction to uncover how much the market thinks a piece of a private company is worth. Make an offer to tell us what you think a company is worth.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                If there is sufficient interest, we will go out and find that stake. When we find a seller, you will participate in an SPV and get units in that private stock. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Is that the end of the game?
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Nope…after the required time, Vex has built a private trading platform where your units can be bought and sold freely. For our crypto friends, there’s even an opportunity to tokenize and explore the wonderful world of AMMs.
                <br/>
